  "about": [
    "Software + AI/ML engineer and Graduate Student Assistant at CSU San Bernardino. I build backend services, internal tools, and data-driven APIs with Python (FastAPI/Flask), SQL, and Docker/CI/CD.",
    "I ship LLM-enabled features—RAG pipelines, embeddings, and vector search (FAISS)—and I’m comfortable working across research + engineering workflows. I’ve also worked with deep learning for segmentation and production-grade data pipelines.",
    "I like owning work end-to-end: requirements → schema/API design → implementation/testing → docs + edge cases, so systems stay reliable and maintainable. Currently pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science, focused on semantic search, text-to-speech, and applied AI."
